PSF generation with STPSF takes a while. Have neglected detector rotation, so the only thing needed from the parameter file is Size (au), nx, ny, Distance (pc) to calculate the pixelscale. If this doesn't change, then easier to copy/paste `psf_fits' into each run

To generate a new `psf_fits' directory, make sure there isn't already one
